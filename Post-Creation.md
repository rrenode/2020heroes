# Introduction

Welcome to Heroes 2020! I'm excited for you to dedicate a story for yourself or others. This example post should hopefully give you an enough understanding of Markdown language to make a simple document.

# YAML and Front-matter

The section at the top of the document is what is called [front-matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter.html) and is written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). You will need to edit each value, the part after the colon (:). Each value should be placed inside of commas ("{your value}"). 

Each varible, the part before the colon, has its own description to tell you what it is. Follow each description and fill-in as needed. Certain values do not need to be entered and will either: not show on the final product or, be replaced by a defualt selection.

## Hero Types

I'm not too happy with using the word "type" for the heros, but I couldn't think of a better word. Hero Types are a way to categorize heros based on occupation and/or size. At first, I used occupation to describe it, but it also does not describe what these words mean in this context.

Examples include:
- Healthcare Workes
- First Responders
- Businesses
- Groups/Families
- The Average Joe

# Images

Please carefully read the following. This could be considered by some the most important rules to understand.

## Usage of Images
Images can be hosted anywhere you would like, just as long as the following rules are followed:
1. You abide by the hosts' own Rules and Term of Service.
    - Certain websites generally do not allow the use of using links of their images to be used on websites. This includes: FaceBook, Imgur, Google Photos, and more. So read their boring Terms of Service or at least Google if it's known you can use the images in this manner. Feel free to upload the images to [imgbb](imgdb). They allow the use of uplaoded photos specifically for this manner.
2. You get consent from the owner of the photo.
    - Please keep in mind copyright laws. Copyrighted material should be avoided unless you are given explicit permission to use the photo for this purpose.
3. You get consent from those who are in the photo.
    - Privacy is personally a large concern of mine on the internet. Please ask the people in the photo if they wouldn't mind being on the internet for this purpose.
4. You understand that people contributing with Heroes2020 will use the photos for various reason.
    - The photos you use on here can and will more than likely be used by the team contributing to Heroes2020 for reasons such as, default images, advertising, and spotlight posts. 
5. The photos are kept family friendly-ish. 
    - Please refrain from using photos that contain excessive amounts of gore, violence, drugs, and such. Always pretend that your kids and/or mother are going to read the posts. While people may differ in their form of "excessive," the point of this website is to spread the joys of the world during such an extraordinary difficult time. 

## Recommended Way to Host Images

Now that you've hopefully understand the usage rules of images that you'll have in your post, let's learn how to actually host them so they can be used for markdown.

### How to upload images:
1. Go to [imgbb](imgdb) and click the "Start Uploading" button
2. A selection of some sort, based on your device, will appear. Choose the images which you would like to use. You can pick 1 or multiple.
3. After you've chosen your images and confirmed, hit "Upload."
4. You'll see some sort of dropdown titled "Embed Codes." Select "Direct Links" from the selections.
5. That link is what can be used in your markdown file. To learn how to use images in Markdown, follow below.

# Markdown

These posts are based off a very simple language called Markdown. Below will be a very simple introduction to Markdown. If you wish to learn more or are having trouble with this documentation, [Markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a fantastic resource. 

## How to Edit Markdown

Markdown can be edited online, or on your computer. [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/) is a fantastic online editor that even helps with syntax!

## Headings

Headings are the titles you see above each section of text. To create a heading, add number signs (#), then a space in front of a word or phrase. The more the signs, the smaller the header.

Examples:
`# Heading 1`
`## Heading 2`
`### Heading 3`

## Basic Text

Basic text is easy in markdown files. Simply just type the text onto the page. Each paragraph can be seperate by a blank line. Paragraphs can be as long or as short as you'd like; though it is recommended to write small and simple paragraphs, or they become very boring.

Example:
```
Markdown is really cool!

I can't wait to write more.
```

## Emphasis

### Bold

To add bold text, add two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) before and after a word or phrase. 

Examples:
`**This is all bold.**`
`__This is all bold__`
`Only part of this sentence is **bold**.`
`Only part of a word is b**ol**d.`

### Italic 

To add italic text, add one asterisk (*) or one underscore (_) before and after a word or phrase.

Examples:
`I italicize things for emphasis, *emphasis*.`
`That reference is from _Drake & Josh_`

## Images

To add images, add and exclamation mark (!), followed by the alt text in brackets, then the path/URL of the image in parentheses. You can also add a title if you would like. Read more about ALt Text [here](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text).
